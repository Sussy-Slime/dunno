          Hi, my name is Quang HÃ o, and also the creator of this website.
      </p>
        <p>
          I have spent a lot of time working on this website (maybe 5 weeks) and in the process 
          of working I also encountered a lot of difficulties. For the first week, everything went 
          very smoothly, nothing went wrong. But from the second and third week, I was sick and that 
          slowed down my work schedule. From the 4th week, I was cured and felt better, but because of 
          the delay, I had to push the urgent work schedule from 1 week to 3 weeks (I was really tired). 
          But luckily, I was able to finish it by week five with the same presentation as when I was in school.
        </p>
